## Notes
 * index.html is the intro page that users connect to, and contains the main log in form that users can connect to
 * login.php is the main page of the project that verifies the users' login information, and if successful, displays the main page.
 * Every other file is the php source code that handles each action. Some php files are purely logic, to insert or retrieve from database. Others are dynamic pages, which are used to display forms and information to the user.
